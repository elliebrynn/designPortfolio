						<h2>Cara Singell Personal Logo</h2>
						<h3>Brand Consulting & Logo Design</h3>

						<p>
							This logo design was a piece commissioned for an aspiring young professional in the Public Relations industry. Cara reached out to me after seeing some of my design work in college and asked if I could help her hone in her visual identity and form an impactful personal mark for use on letterheads, resumes and her personal website. I gladly obliged and we got to work defining the way she wished to be identified. Cara initially described her personal style to be "bold, creative, but minimal" and wanted to be perceived professionally as being "confident, flexible and unique". I let her desires to stand out in a pool of qualified PR candidates in a large corporate pool inform my design decisions. We worked together to create a moodboard that would help me understand more clearly what she is drawn to and how she perceives herself. The initial direction I went in used chunky silhouettes and bold but friendly letterforms in a way that was refined, but communicated creativity. I presented 6 initial concepts, refined and in color, in order to help her consider them in context.

							She was quite thrown off by the color choice I mocked them up in, relaying that the palette was too loud and unprofessional. She also requested that we shift direction because she felt uneasy about how the design was being informed by the "bold", "strong" and "unique" descriptors. She decided that she wanted to be perceived softer and more personal. She chose phrasing like "minimal but inviting" and asked me to create a logo design that felt more like a personal invitation. She also mentioned that she preferred a more natural color palette, sending me Pantone swatches that she was more drawn to. This was immensely helpful, because although we initially tried to dig deep into how she wanted to be represented, I think she was still discovering her brand for herself. We decided to stray away from the bold and chunky marks and embark on a more subdued direction. I let script lettering and hand drawn elements lead the way, while intending to still maintain a creative and confident presentation.

							The next round of concepts were received with much more enthusiasm and she felt identified with quite a few of the concepts. After some tweaks, she decided on a favorite, so I went ahead and refined it to its final version. I also created for her a small custom brand guide so that she could used the mark effectively in any context.
						<p>
							Cara felt heard and that her personal brand had been well captured in the logo design, and she greatly appreciated the additional direction that the brand guide provided. The final mark is approachable yet refined, communicating the flexible yet confident nature that Cara will bring to any role she may fill in the PR industry.
